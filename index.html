      <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
        were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
        honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h2>

          " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the Bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
          I signed up for 
          the free inro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. the next 12 
          weeks were the best and most grueling time of my life.
          since completing the course, I've
          successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR start-up."

      <h2>the team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h2>
      <p>" I started as a total newbie with
        virtually no coding skills.
        I now work
        as a mobile engineer for a big
        company.
        it was one of the bes
        investments I've made in myself."</p>

      <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
      <p>"before joining the Bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
        I needesome structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
        I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
        the entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
        they were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
        the agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way
        that no tutorial could ever have
        in
        fact, I have often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.
        it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple  offers. 100% recommended."

      <h2>awesome teaching support from TAs who did the Bootcamp<br> themselves. getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy</h2>
      <p>"the staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. the program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
